            <h2><b>Reviews on</b> <em>Transformers</em></h2>

            <p> Five out of Five - 5/5
                I haven't seen any of the tv shows nor the movies from the 1980s starring the popular transformers, and based on the premise, it doesn't seem to reflect reality. However, after experiencing the gripping opening scene, Michael Bay's riveting summer blockbuster, "Transformers," sets up an imaginative universe. It is inspired by the Hasbro company toy line, so it could be a creative undertaking from a child's perspective; indicating it's imaginative sci-fi escapism, so that we can allow ourselves to turn our brains off and enjoy the ride. Also, I wasn't expecting the stakes to be so high and feel palpable.
                
                The plot concerns Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBouf), a teenage boy who wants a new car, a yellow Camaro to be percised. Little did he know that his new car is alive, and it chose Sam, because he might be the only hope who can protect the AllsSark, a powerful cube that brings life to vehicles and electronics that transform into robots, it can also start a war between the heroic Autobots and the evil Decepticons. Sam has a great great grandfather who was an Arctic explorer. 
                
                What I find pleasing about "Transformers" is that at it's core, it offers an underdog story about heroism, teamwork, compassion, and freedom. It can also show that creativity can unleash imagination, and it has some interesting backstories. Some of the lines of dialogue are memorable. The film has silly tongue-in-cheek humor, and yet I laughed heartily at least eleven times at the more surprisingly slick comedic moments, and it also has some clever pop culture references. As a sumptuous action blockbuster, it is overwhelming in spades; moving at a fine, breezy pace throughout it's two-and-a-half-hour running time, It is an exciting ride of epic proportions with intense action, hard-hitting impact, uneasy tension, daring stunts, and sizable wonder, happening all the way up to a happy ending that delivers an agreeable sense of gratification. Michael Bay and Mitchell Amundsen enhances the action with swooping camera movements, explosions that blow stuff up real good, effective slow motion, and even shaking the camera. The special effects are nothing short of astounding with photorealistic detail, and conversion process. The impressive sound effects matches the high-quality of the special effects. Elevating the film is the big, bold music score by Steve Jablonsky. The score delivers an imposing sense of audacity, majesty, and Dread. 
                
                The entire cast is pitch-perfect for their characters, and all of their interactions are so convincing. Shia LaBouf is absolutely solid as Sam; an underdog of teenager who is insecure, yet he can be smart at times, he does have some heart, and he is understandably antsy with apprehensive urgency, and he also tends to not think straight as well in some situations which I find convincing, because sometimes we humans accidently let our minds go blank yet remain ourselves alert in situations that we are no ready for. Mikaela (Megan Fox) makes a good attractive classmate for Sam. John Voight would make a fine leader for the defense department. Anthony Anderson is solid as a funny yet supportive comic relief. Peter Cullen is magnificent as Optimus Prime; delivering regal, full-bodied resonance via warmth and power. Optimus Prime is the leader of the Autobots, and he is the god of this universe who knows everything about the human race. The Decepticons are as frightening as the T-800 from "The Terminator," in terms of appearances and dispositions. The leader of the Decepticons is the formidable and power-hungry Megatron. Hugo Weaving voices Megatron with snarling ferocity.
                
                Highly Recommended (suitable for teens thirteen and up).<em> -Kyle Vansteelandt</em></p>

                 <p>After watching this film as an adult on the theater on the recent Fathom Event, I have to say it's one of the best cinematic experiences I ever had! 

                    The film was a spectacle from beginning to end, and in my view, better than most big budget films put out there lately like those from Marvel and Disney. It didnt feel like those “Factory Movies” that are out there lately just to "milk" a franchise, this felt new and refreshing even though its from 2007. Its easy to tell this was groundbreaking back in the day. 
                    
                    Judging this from an objective filmmaking standpoint, it was really good and cleverly made. The story points were impressive for being a toy franchise. I am just shocked that a toy franchise has a film this good for cinema! And regardless of what you think of Michael Bay, he did bring an excellent story in this film. 
                    
                    The spectacle was something else, the cinematography was next level, the music was astounding, the sounds really pull you in, and even the slow motion scenes were impressive. It really left you in awe. 
                    
                    The only complaint one could think of with the film is that theres no character development. But realistically, thats like complaining an EV has no V8 engine. There was no room in this film for character development by the intriguing plot, but you didnt even miss character development because the plot and the spectacle was so good. 
                    
                    One of the best, if not the best cinematic experiences I ever had. 
                    
                    I suggest you watch this on the biggest screen possible and with the best speakers so you can have the best experience. Be prepared; it's going to be one wild ride. Don't expect character development, because the action will take all your attention.<em> -Fortimus Prime</em></p>
